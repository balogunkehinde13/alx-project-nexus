## ⚙️ Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|------------|-----------|
| Integrating multiple APIs into a single frontend | Implemented reusable Axios hooks and modular API utilities for cleaner data fetching. |
| Handling type errors in large TypeScript projects | Adopted strict typing, interfaces, and generic utility types for consistency. |
| Styling complex components efficiently | Leveraged TailwindCSS and reusable component patterns to improve scalability. |
| Managing state across nested components | Used React Context and custom hooks to simplify state sharing. |
| Debugging build issues in Next.js | Utilized environment variables, dynamic imports, and error boundaries for stability. |

## 🌱 Best Practices and Personal Takeaways

- **Write clean, modular, and reusable code** — simplicity scales better than complexity.  
- **Plan before coding** — design systems, workflows, and UI logic upfront.  
- **Test early and often** — catching small issues prevents bigger ones later.  
- **Leverage documentation** — good engineers read before they reinvent.  
- **Collaborate and communicate** — team-based learning sharpens understanding.  
- **Performance matters** — optimize for speed, accessibility, and user experience.  
- **Continuous learning** — frontend evolves fast; curiosity is a superpower.

## 🧩 Project Nexus: Interactive Online Polling Platform

### Overview
This case study focuses on building an **interactive online polling platform** where users can vote on polls and view live results in real-time. The project emphasizes **dynamic data visualization**, **real-time updates**, and **seamless user interaction**, demonstrating practical skills in modern frontend development using **React/Next.js**.

### 🎯 Project Goals
The primary objectives of the project are:
- **API Integration:** Fetch and display poll questions and live results from an API.
- **State Management:** Use Redux to manage global state efficiently.
- **Dynamic Visualizations:** Render live poll results using charts and animations for clarity and engagement.

### 🧰 Technologies Used
- **React / Next.js** – For component-based UI and SSR.  
- **Redux Toolkit** – To handle global state management and real-time updates.  
- **TypeScript** – Ensuring type safety and maintainable code.  
- **Charting Library (e.g., Recharts or Chart.js)** – For data visualization of poll results.  
- **TailwindCSS** – For responsive design and flexible UI styling.  

### 🌟 Key Features

#### 1. Poll Creation and Voting
- Users can create new polls with customizable options.  
- Users can vote on active polls and share polls via link or QR code.  

#### 2. Real-Time Results Display
- Fetches and displays live results as votes are cast.  
- Updates charts dynamically without requiring a page refresh.  

#### 3. Dynamic Visualizations
- Interactive charts visualize votes per option.  
- Visuals adapt responsively across mobile and desktop devices.  

#### 4. Form Validation
- Input validation ensures all poll fields are complete before submission.  
- Provides user-friendly feedback for invalid or incomplete forms.

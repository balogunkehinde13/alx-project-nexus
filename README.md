## ⚙️ Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|------------|-----------|
| Integrating multiple APIs into a single frontend | Implemented reusable Axios hooks and modular API utilities for cleaner data fetching. |
| Handling type errors in large TypeScript projects | Adopted strict typing, interfaces, and generic utility types for consistency. |
| Styling complex components efficiently | Leveraged TailwindCSS and reusable component patterns to improve scalability. |
| Managing state across nested components | Used React Context and custom hooks to simplify state sharing. |
| Debugging build issues in Next.js | Utilized environment variables, dynamic imports, and error boundaries for stability. |

## 🌱 Best Practices and Personal Takeaways

- **Write clean, modular, and reusable code** — simplicity scales better than complexity.  
- **Plan before coding** — design systems, workflows, and UI logic upfront.  
- **Test early and often** — catching small issues prevents bigger ones later.  
- **Leverage documentation** — good engineers read before they reinvent.  
- **Collaborate and communicate** — team-based learning sharpens understanding.  
- **Performance matters** — optimize for speed, accessibility, and user experience.  
- **Continuous learning** — frontend evolves fast; curiosity is a superpower.
